    rtype: returns a list of tuples. Each tuple is structured as:
            (index of the derived level, list of dependent levels)
    In the example above, the indicies of the design are:
        idx: level:
        0    color:red
        1    color:blue
        2    text:red
        3    text:blue
        4    conFactor:con
        5    conFactor:inc
    So the tuple (4, [[0,2], [1,3]]) represents the information that
        the derivedLevel con is true iff
            (color:red && text:red) ||
            (color:blue && text:blue)
        by pairing the relevant indicies together.

    This is a helper function that shifts the idxs of __process_derivations.
    ie, if its a Transition(op.eq, [color, color]) (ie "repeat" color transition)
        then the indexes for the levels of color would be like (0, 0), (1, 1)
        but actually, the window size for a transition is 2, so what we really want is the indicies
        (0, 5), (1, 6) (assuming there are 4 levels in the design)
    So this helper function shifts over indices that were meant to be intepretted as being in a subsequent trial.
