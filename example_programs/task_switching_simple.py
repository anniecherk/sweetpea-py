Task Switching Design (simple)

factors (levels):
- current color (red, blue)
- current motion (up, down)
- current task (color, motion)
- correct response (left, right): dependent factor.
- congruency (congruent, incongruent): dependent factor.
- task transition (repetition, switch). dependent factor of task:
- response transition (repetition, switch). dependent factor of correct response:

constraints:
- counterbalancing congruency x response x task x task-transition x response-transition x color x motion
- no more than 7 task repetitions in a row
- no more than 7 task switches in a row
- no more than 7 response repetitions in a row
- no more than 7 response switches in a row
